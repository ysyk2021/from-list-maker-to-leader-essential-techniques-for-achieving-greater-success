There are various types of leadership styles, including:

* Autocratic: A leader who makes decisions without input from others.
* Democratic: A leader who values input and feedback from team members before making decisions.
* Transformational: A leader who inspires and motivates their team to achieve a common goal or vision.

Effective leaders often use a combination of these styles depending on the situation and the needs of their team.
